here are some rules for contributing assets:
generally, they should bear at least somewhat of a resemblance to their Doom equivalents, whether it be
enemies, weapons, textures, music, sounds, levels, they should all give off a Doom vibe to them
enemies must look at least somewhat like their Doom counterparts, they don't have to be
exactly the same, in fact, i discourage it, but they should at least look somewhat similar, you can
look at my concept art in the /concept art folder to see what i mean
all maps must be 100% vanilla compatible, and use no textures that aren't in the Doom or Doom 2 IWADs,
they should also try to maintain somewhat of a resemblance to their Doom equivalents, they shouldn't
look exactly the same, but they should have roughly the same areas in roughly the same places
as the Doom equivalent maps, although you don't have to use the same textures, you can use any
textures you want
MIDIs of all genres are accepted, although a hiphop/horrorcore style is preferred
when it comes to textures, don't try to censor out any Satanic or Nazi imagery, and use IAC instead of
UAC or AGM, templates for the IAC logo can be found in the /patches folder
it's heavily encouraged that all contributed assets are under the Unlicense, although any permissive
free license can be used, such as Creative Commons or the BSD license
