here are some rules for contributing assets:
generally, they should bear at least somewhat of a resemblance to their Doom equivalents, whether it be
enemies, weapons, textures, music, sounds, levels, they should all give off a Doom vibe to them
enemies must look at least somewhat like their Doom counterparts, they don't have to be
exactly the same, in fact, i discourage it, but they should at least look somewhat similar, you can
look at my concept art in the /concept art folder to see what i mean
all maps must be 100% vanilla compatible, and use no textures that aren't in the Doom or Doom 2 IWADs,
it's encouraged that they should also try to maintain somewhat of a resemblance to their Doom equivalents, 
they shouldn't look exactly the same, but they should have roughly the same areas in roughly the same places
as the Doom equivalent maps, it's not required, but it's encouraged
MIDIs of all genres are accepted, although a hiphop/horrorcore style is preferred
when it comes to textures, don't try to censor out any Satanic or Nazi imagery, and use IAC instead of
UAC or AGM, templates for the IAC logo can be found in the /patches folder
don't use WADs outside of maps, for other things, like sounds or textures, 
put them in a zip file, it avoids the problem of me needing to open a WAD in SLADE and move them to the deutex tree
please put sprite offsets in a text file instead of putting them directly on the images, it's quite a chore to 
have to open each individual frame in SLADE and then copy the offsets to the buildcfg
don't use copyrighted assets, i intend for this project to be 
100% free for commercial use and public domain, and i can't use copyrighted assets in a project of this type
for audio contributions, i encourage that you provide a lossless version of the audio alongside the lossy version, 
i do plan on using 44khz audio for the eventual GZDoom version of the project, and having lossless versions of 
the audio already would be great 
it's heavily encouraged that all contributed assets are under the Unlicense, although any permissive
free license can be used, such as Creative Commons or the BSD license
