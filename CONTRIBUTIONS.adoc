Here are some rules for contributing assets:

1: All maps must be limit removing or vanilla compatible, and use no textures that aren't in the approved list, all maps must also come in at 256 kilobytes or less

2: MIDIs of all genres are accepted, although a hiphop/horrorcore style is preferred

3: When it comes to textures, don't try to censor out any Satanic or Nazi imagery, and use IAC instead of UAC or AGM, templates for the IAC logo can be found in the /patches folder in the Github

4: Don't use WADs outside of maps, for other things, like sounds or textures, put them in a zip file, it avoids the problem of me needing to open a WAD in SLADE and move them to the deutex tree

5: Please put sprite offsets in a text file instead of putting them directly on the images, it's quite a chore to
have to open each individual frame in SLADE and then copy the offsets to the buildcfg

6: Don't use copyrighted assets, i intend for this project to be 100% free for commercial use and public domain, and i can't use copyrighted assets in a project of this type

7: For audio contributions, i encourage that you provide a lossless version of the audio alongside the lossy version, i do plan on using 44khz audio for the eventual GZDoom version of the project, and having lossless versions of the audio already would be great

8: All contributions must have a license attached to them, the exact license doesn't matter, if it's a permissive free license that allows for commercial use, like the 3 clause BSD license, the Unlicense, or Creative Commons, i can use it in the project, although use of the Unlicense is strongly encouraged

APPROVED TEXTURE LIST:

Any texture that can be found in the TEXTURE1 or TEXTURE2 of Doom or Doom 2
