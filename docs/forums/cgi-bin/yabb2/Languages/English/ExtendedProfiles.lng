But before you start, you should know a couple of things:<br /><br />Before you start adding fields wildly, make sure to think about what fields you really want/need. Try to avoid late and big changes because your members may have to modify their profiles according to these changes every time they are made. Also note that as more fields you add, as bigger your profiles will be.<br /><br />Finally make sure your board is in <b>maintenance mode</b> before adding or deleting fields to avoid users who change their profile while changes are made.',

However if you for example turn a radiobutton field to textbox, you should concern this modification does not affect the data which users may already have entered in their profiles. So if a user has chosen the first option and you turn it into a textbox, he will have a 0 in this field until he changes his profile.<br />To clear whatever the user had in this field, you should rather delete the whole field and than add a new one. That&#39;s the only way to clear a specific field&#39;s content.<br />Also make sure to change the options of this field since different types may have different options available.<br /><br />Using the &#39;Delete&#39; button may take some time since it has to go through all profile files.',
