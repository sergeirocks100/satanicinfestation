Module  : Compatibility: iconv extension
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Phorum Dev Team

This module implements a fallback for PHP's iconv() function,
in case the "iconv" PHP extension is not enabled.

Thanks to Mikołaj Jędrzejak for the implementation of his
Convert Charset class. See: http://mikolajj.republika.pl/

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive and move the directory "compat_iconv" to the
  directory "mods" within your Phorum installation (unless this module
  was packaged with your Phorum release);

- There is no need to enable the module manually. If your system needs
  it, Phorum will automatically load the module.
