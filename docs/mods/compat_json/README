Module  : Compatibility: json extension
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Phorum Dev Team

This module implements a fallback for PHP's json_encode() and
json_decode() functions, in case the "json" PHP extension
is not enabled.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive and move the directory "compat_json" to the directory
  "mods" within your Phorum installation (unless this module was packaged
  with your Phorum release);

- There is no need to enable the module manually. If your system needs
  it, Phorum will automatically load the module.
