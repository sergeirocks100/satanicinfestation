Module  : Compatibility: stripos extension
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Phorum Dev Team

This module implements a fallback for PHP's stripos() function,
in case that function is not available.

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive and move the directory "compat_stripos" to the
  directory "mods" within your Phorum installation (unless this module
  was packaged with your Phorum release);

- There is no need to enable the module manually. If your system needs
  it, Phorum will automatically load the module.
