    Satanic Infestation is my fork of Freedoom, because i disagree with the way it's going,
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    the project seems to be trying to just make something that vaguely resembles Doom rather than a 100% free copy of it,
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    all of the references to Satanism and Naziism have been scrubbed clean, the enemies bear only a slight resemblance to
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    their Doom counterparts at best, and no resemblance at worst, and it generally doesn't capture the vibe of Doom
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    well, my goal is to make a 100% free IWAD that is as close to Doom as i can legally make it,
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    the enemies, weapons, textures, themes, and maps will all bear more of a resemblance to Doom,
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    i'm only using Freedoom as a basis, as time goes on, i will replace more and more of Freedoom's assets with my own, and,
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    eventually, all of the old assets will be replaced, anybody is free to contribute assets,
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    but i plan for this to be more or less something of my own making, further detais on rules and other information about
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    asset contributions can be found in CONTRIBUTIONS.adoc, credits go to the Freedoom contributors for making it easier
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    for me to do this project by providing their assets, thank you to them, 
    </p>
	<p class="sansserif">
    and thanks in advance to anybody who submits their work to this project
